## Initial thoughts on setting up project.

What are my models, their associations, and their attributes?
  - After viewing seed data, my models and attributes are largely given however, I 
    need to implement timeline and github data. Are these separate models or do I add more attributes to user and order all models by timestamps?
  - Something I noticed was under user seed data, only some github names are provided.

What are my routes and their operations?
  - Not a priority yet. I'll open up all routes for debugging and user boiler plate operations.
  
What are the technologies/gems/tools I need to use outside of a basic CRUD app?
  - After viewing csv seed data, I may need to hard code a few lines of seed data to set up initial models and get app working. Once completed, I plan on researching csv parsing tools.
  - I need to query github for data...use simple curl or use gem for api queries?
  - Need to research authentication gems as all users come with email. Assuming tokens need to be used as this api is mainly for mobile devices.
    - Use Tiddle?
  - Limiting items on timeline, use gem or use vanilla ruby?
    - Use Pagnate or will_pagnate?
